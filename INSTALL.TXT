Obtaining the latest source
===========================

The latest source code for Py-ART can be obtained from the GitHub repository,
https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart.

The latest source can be checked out using

    $ git clone https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart.git


Installing from Source
======================

The path to the TRMM RSL library must be provided during install.  This can
either be done by setting the `RSL_PATH` environmentation variable.  In bash
this can be done using `export RSL_PATH=/path/to/rsl/`. If this location is
not specified, some common locations will be searched.  Note that the location
provided should be the root TRMM RSL path, under which both a `lib` and
`include` directory are contained, the default location is `/lib/local/trmm`.

After specifying the TRMM RSL path Py-ART can be installed globally using

    $ python setup.py install

of locally using

    $ python setup.py install --user

If you prefer to use Py-ART without installing, simply add the this path to
your PYTHONPATH (directory or with a .pth file) and compile the extension
in-place.

    $ python setup.py build_ext -i

Frequently asked questions
==========================

Q) I'm getting a segfault or another error in python when using
     rsl.read_rsl() with IRIS/other files.
A)  This is due to a bug in RSL, and can be remedied by adding
    -fno-stack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0 to the CFLAGS parameter of the
    makefile of rsl.  This issue has been reported to the RSL maintainers.

Obtaining the latest source
===========================

The latest source code for Py-ART can be obtained from the GitHub repository,
https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart.

The latest source can be checked out using
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart.git


Installing from Source
======================

The path to the TRMM RSL library must be provided during install.  This can
either be done by setting the `RSL_PATH` environmentation variable.  In bash
this can be done using `export RSL_PATH=/path/to/rsl/`. If this location is
not specified, some common locations will be searched.  Note that the location
provided should be the root TRMM RSL path, under which both a `lib` and
`include` directory are contained, the default location is `/lib/local/trmm`.

After specifying the TRMM RSL path Py-ART can be installed globally using

    $ python setup.py install

of locally using

    $ python setup.py install --user

If you prefer to use Py-ART without installing, simply add the this path to 
your PYTHONPATH (directory or with a .pth file) and compile the extension
in-place.

    $ python setup.py build_ext -i

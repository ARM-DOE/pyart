The Python ARM Radar Toolkit, Py-ART, is an open source Python module
containing a growing collection of weather radar algorithms and utilities
build on top of the Scientific Python stack and distributed under the
3-Clause BSD license. Py-ART is used by the
`Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) User Facility
<http://www.arm.gov>`_ for working with data from a number of precipitation
and cloud radars, but has been designed so that it can be used by others in
the radar and atmospheric communities to examine, processes, and analyze
data from many types of weather radars.

Citing
======

If you use the Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) to prepare a publication
please cite:

    Helmus, J.J. & Collis, S.M., (2016). The Python ARM Radar Toolkit
    (Py-ART), a Library for Working with Weather Radar Data in the Python
    Programming Language. Journal of Open Research Software. 4(1), p.e25.
    DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/jors.119

Py-ART implements many published scientific methods which should *also* be
cited if you make use of them. Refer to the **References** section in the
documentation of the functions used for information on these citations.


Install
=======

The easiest method for installing Py-ART is to use the conda packages from
the latest release and use Python 3, as Python 2 support ended January 1st,
2020 and many packages including Py-ART no longer support Python 2.
To do this you must download and install
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#>`_ or
`Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_.
With Anaconda or Miniconda install, it is recommended to create a new conda
environment when using Py-ART or even other packages. To create a new
environment based on the `environment.yml <https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart/blob/master/environment.yml>`_::

    conda env create -f environment.yml

Or for a basic environment and downloading optional dependencies as needed::

    conda create -n pyart_env -c conda-forge python=3.9 arm_pyart

Basic command in a terminal or command prompt to install the latest version of
Py-ART::

    conda install -c conda-forge arm_pyart

To update an older version of Py-ART to the latest release use::

    conda update -c conda-forge arm_pyart

If you are using mamba::

    mamba install -c conda-forge arm_pyart

If you do not wish to use Anaconda or Miniconda as a Python environment or want
to use the latest, unreleased version of Py-ART see the section below on
**Installing from source**.


Configuration
=============

The configuration file in Py-ART specifies the default metadata, field names,
colormaps and plot limits. A custom configuration can be loaded
automatically be setting the environmental variable **PYART_CONFIG** to point
to a custom configuration file. For additional details on this process see the
documentation on the `pyart.load_config` function.


Extensions and related software
===============================

A number of projects are available which extend the functionality of Py-ART.
These include:

* `ARTView <https://github.com/nguy/artview>`_ :
  Interactive radar viewing browser.

* `pyrad <https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/pyrad>`_ :

  from one or more Doppler weather radars.


Dependencies
============

Py-ART is tested to work under Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

The required dependencies to install Py-ART in addition to Python are:

* `NumPy <https://www.numpy.org/>`_
* `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org>`_
* `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_
* `netCDF4 <https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python>`_
* `pooch <https://pypi.org/project/pooch/>`_
* `Cython <https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
* `setuptools <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html>`_

A working C/C++ compiler is required for some optional modules. An easy method
to install these dependencies is by using a
`Scientific Python distributions <http://scipy.org/install.html>`_.
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ will install all of
the above packages by default on Windows, Linux and Mac computers and is
provided free of charge by Anaconda. Anaconda also has their own compilers,
which may be required for optional dependencies such as CyLP. These compilers
can be found here:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/compiler-tools.html


Optional Dependences
====================

The above Python modules are require before installing Py-ART, additional
functionality is available of the following modules are installed.

* `TRMM Radar Software Library (RSL)
  <https://trmm-fc.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_gv/software/rsl/>`_.
  If installed Py-ART will be able to read in radar data in a number of
  additional formats (Lassen, McGill, Universal Format, and RADTEC) and
  perform automatic dealiasing of Doppler velocities.  RSL should be
  install prior to installing Py-ART. The environmental variable `RSL_PATH`
  should point to the location where RSL was installed if RSL was not
  installed in the default location (/usr/local/trmm), such as a anaconda path
  (/usr/anaconda3/envs/pyart_env/.

* In order to read files which are stored in HDF5 files the
  `h5py <https://www.h5py.org/>`_ package and related libraries must be
  installed.

* A linear programming solver and Python wrapper to use the LP phase
  processing method. `CyLP <https://github.com/mpy/CyLP>`_ is recommended as
  it gives the fastest results, but
  `PyGLPK <https://tfinley.net/software/pyglpk/>`_ and
  `CVXOPT <https://cvxopt.org/>`_ are also supported. The underlying LP
  solvers `CBC <https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc>`_ or
  `GLPK <https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`_ will also be required depending
  on which wrapper is used. When using `CyLP <https://github.com/mpy/CyLP>`_
  a path to coincbc is needed by setting the `COIN_INSTALL_DIR` path, such as
  (/usr/anaconda3/envs/pyart_env/).

* `Cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_. If installed,
  the ability to plot grids on geographic maps is available.

* `xarray <https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_. If installed, gives the
  ability to work with the grid dataset used in grid plotting.

* `Basemap <https://matplotlib.org/basemap/>`_. If installed, also gives the
  ability to plot grids on geographic maps, but Cartopy is recommended over
  Basemap.

* `wradlib <https://docs.wradlib.org/en/latest/>`_.  Needed to calculate the texture
  of a differential phase field.

* `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_.
  Required to run the Py-ART unit tests.

* `gdal <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/>`_.
  Required to output GeoTIFFs from `Grid` objects.

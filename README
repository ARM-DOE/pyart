Welcome to the Python ARM Radar toolkit. 
This toolkit contains a variety of utilities that can be strung together to produce applications for:
*Reading Radar data
*Correcting radar data in antenna coordinates
*Mapping data to a Cartesian Grid
*Performing retrievals on this mapped data
*Doing calculations on the retievals
*And finally writing both radial and Cartesian data to documented NetCDF files

Dependancies:
Python 2.6+ with
-netCDF4
-numpy
-scipy
-ctypes
-matplotlib

NASA Radar Software Libriary (RSL) 1.43+ and dependancies required to build (Automake etc...)

Installation:
Currently the only build option is inplace, later we plan to port to using distutils and allow a system wide install. For now unpack your Py-ART distribution where you plan to have it installed.

STEP 1: Build py4dd, a version of RSL patched with the Univeristy of Washington 4D Dealias code.
set the variable PYART_DIR to the base dir of your pyart install ie if I have unpacked pyart in /home/user/python/pyart I would set PYART_DIR to /home/user/python
Unless you want to set this before each Py-ART session set this in your .bashrc or whatever. Note also that as we use a sys.path.append($PYART_DIR) please ensure this does not play havoc with you module search.

Copy the RSL tarball to $PYART_DIR/pyart/io/src
Check that the VERSION is correct in $PYART_DIR/pyart/io/src/patch_and_make.sh
cd $PYART_DIR/pyart/io/src/
./patch_and_make.sh

Cheer if it works!

This will create a shared library in $PYART_DIR//pyart/io/lib/librsl.so.1.0.43

STEP 2: Build the ball tree mapper
cd $PYART_DIR/pyart/map/ball_tree
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
cp $PYART_DIR/pyart/map/ball_tree/ball_tree/ball_tree.so $PYART_DIR/pyart/map/

STEP 3: Test

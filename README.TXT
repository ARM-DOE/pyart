Welcome to the Python ARM Radar toolkit!

This toolkit contains a variety of utilities that can be strung together to 
produce applications for:
    * Reading Radar data
    * Correcting radar data in antenna coordinates
    * Mapping data to a Cartesian Grid
    * Performing retrievals on this mapped data
    * Doing calculations on the retievals
    * Writing both radial and Cartesian data to NetCDF files.


Dependancies:

Python 2.6+ with
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib
    - netCDF4

Welcome to the Python ARM Radar toolkit!
This toolkit contains a variety of utilities that can be strung together to produce applications for:
*Reading Radar data
*Correcting radar data in antenna coordinates
*Mapping data to a Cartesian Grid
*Performing retrievals on this mapped data
*Doing calculations on the retievals
*And finally writing both radial and Cartesian data to documented NetCDF files


Dependancies:

Python 2.6+ with
-numpy
-scipy
-matplotlib
-netCDF4
-PyGLPK


NASA TRMM Radar Software Libriary (RSL) 1.43+ and dependancies required to build 
(Automake etc...)

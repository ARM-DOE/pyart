Installation

Required Dependencies
=====================

Py-ART requires the following software.

* Python__ 3.6.x, 3.7.x or 3.8x

__ http://www.python.org

* NumPy__

__ http://www.scipy.org

* SciPy__

__ http://www.scipy.org

* matplotlib__

__ http://matplotlib.org/

* netCDF4__

__ https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python


Optional Dependencies
=====================

The following packages are recommended for a fully-functional Py-ART
installation, but the package will install and work with reduced functionality
without these packages.

* `TRMM RSL <https://trmm-fc.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_gv/software/rsl/>`_

* `CyLP <https://github.com/mpy/CyLP>`_ or 
  `PyGLPK <https://tfinley.net/software/pyglpk/>`_ or
  `CVXOPT <https://cvxopt.org/>`_ and their dependencies.

* `Cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_ or
* `Basemap <https://matplotlib.org/basemap/>`_ But Cartopy is recommended as
  basemap will no longer have support.

* `xarray <https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_
* `pyproj <https://code.google.com/p/pyproj/>`_

* `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_

Obtaining the latest source
===========================

The latest source code for Py-ART can be obtained from the GitHub repository,
https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart.

The latest source can be checked out using

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart.git


Installing from Source
======================

The path to the TRMM RSL library must be provided during install. This can
either be done by setting the ``RSL_PATH`` environmentation variable. In bash
this can be done using ``export RSL_PATH=/path/to/rsl/``. If this location is
not specified, some common locations will be searched. Note that the location
provided should be the root TRMM RSL path, under which both a `lib` and
`include` directory are contained, the default location is ``/lib/local/trmm``.
If using CyLP, a path for the coincbc directory is needed. This can be done
using ``export COIN_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/coincbc/``. When using CyLP, on some
systems, installing the Anaconda compilers is needed. These can be found here:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/compiler-tools.html

After specifying the TRMM RSL path Py-ART can be installed globally using

::

    $ python setup.py install

of locally using

::

    $ python setup.py install --user

If you prefer to use Py-ART without installing, simply add the this path to
your ``PYTHONPATH`` (directory or with a .pth file) and compile the extension
in-place.

::

    $ python setup.py build_ext -i

You can also install Py-ART in development mode by using

::

    $ pip install -e .

Frequently asked questions
==========================

* I'm getting a no 'io' module after installing pyart with pip.

  There is a pyart on pip that is a different package. Make sure to do::

      pip install arm_pyart

  and not::

      pip install pyart

* I'm getting a segfault or compile error with CyLP in newer Python versions
  when installing in an environment.

  Anaconda has its own compilers now on conda-forge. Theres can be found here:
  https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/compiler-tools.html
  Once the proper compilers are installed, reinstall CyLP.

* I'm getting a segfault or another error in python when using 
  ``pyart.io.read_rsl()`` with IRIS/other files.
  
  This is due to a bug in RSL, and can be remedied by adding
  ``-fno-stack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0`` to the CFLAGS parameter of the
  makefile of RSL.  This issue has been fixed with the release of rsl-v1.44.

* I'm having trouble getting PyGLPK to compile on my 64-bit operating system.
  
  Change the line in the setup.py file from
  
  ::
  
      define_macros = macros, extra_compile_args=['-m32'], extra_link_args=['-m32'],
  
  to
  
  ::
  
      define_macros = macros, extra_compile_args=['-m64'], extra_link_args=['-m64'],

  Then build and install PyGLPK as recommended in the PYGLPK README.txt file.

* When running basemap, I get an error 'KeyError: PROJ_LIB'.

  Basemap is not being supported beyond 2020, some of these errors relate
  to it not playing nicely with newer versions of packages. We recommend using
  Cartopy instead, but some users have been able to use:
  import os
  os.environ['PROJ_LIB'] = 'C:/Users/xx Username xxx/Anaconda3/Lib/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/basemap'
  To get basemap working, but again Cartopy should be used instead of Basemap.

    Create a filter which removes undesired gates based on moments.

    Creates a gate filter in which the following gates are excluded:

    * Gates where the reflectivity is outside the interval min_refl, max_refl.
    * Gates where the normalized coherent power is below min_ncp.
    * Gates where the cross correlation ratio is below min_rhi.  Using the
      default parameter this filtering is disabled.
    * Gates where any of the above three fields are masked or contain
      invalid values (NaNs or infs).
    * If any of these three fields do not exist in the radar that fields filter
      criteria is not applied.

    Parameters
    ----------
    radar : Radar
        Radar object from which the gate filter will be built.
    refl_field, ncp_field, rhv_field : str
        Names of the radar fields which contain the reflectivity, normalized
        coherent power (signal quality index) and cross correlation ratio
        (RhoHV) from which the gate filter will be created using the above
        criteria.  A value of None for any of these parameters will use the
        default field name as defined in the Py-ART configuration file.
    min_ncp, min_rhv : float
        Minimum values for the normalized coherence power and cross
        correlation ratio.  Gates in these fields below these limits as well as
        gates which are masked or contain invalid values will be excluded and
        not used in calculation which use the filter.  A value of None will
        disable filtering based upon the given field including removing
        masked or gates with an invalid value.  To disable the thresholding
        but retain the masked and invalid filter set the parameter to a value
        below the lowest value in the field.
    min_refl, max_refl : float
        Minimum and maximum values for the reflectivity.  Gates outside
        of this interval as well as gates which are masked or contain invalid
        values will be excluded and not used in calculation which use this
        filter. A value or None for one of these parameters will disable the
        minimum or maximum filtering but retain the other.  A value of None
        for both of these values will disable all filtering based upon the
        reflectivity including removing masked or gates with an invalid value.
        To disable the interval filtering but retain the masked and invalid
        filter set the parameters to values above and below the lowest and
        greatest values in the reflectivity field.

    Returns
    -------
    gatefilter : :py:class:`GateFilter`
        A gate filter based upon the described criteria.  This can be
        used as a gatefilter parameter to various functions in pyart.correct.

    """
    A class for building a boolean arrays for filtering gates based on
    a set of condition typically based on the values in the radar fields.
    These filter can be used in various algorithms and calculations within
    Py-ART.

    See :py:func:`pyart.correct.GateFilter.exclude_below` for method
    parameter details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    radar : Radar
        Radar object from which gate filter will be build.
    exclude_based : bool, optional
        True, the default and suggested method, will begin with all gates
        included and then use the exclude methods to exclude gates based on
        conditions.  False will begin with all gates excluded from which
        a set of gates to include should be set using the include methods.

    Attributes
    ----------
    gate_excluded : array, dtype=bool
        Boolean array indicating if a gate should be excluded from a
        calculation. Elements marked True indicate the corresponding gate
        should be excluded.  Those marked False should be included.
        This is read-only attribute, any changes to the array will NOT
        be reflected in gate_included and will be lost when the attribute is
        accessed again.
    gate_included : array, dtype=bool
        Boolean array indicating if a gate should be included in a
        calculation. Elements marked True indicate the corresponding gate
        should be include.  Those marked False should be excluded.
        This is read-only attribute, any changes to the array will NOT
        be reflected in gate_excluded and will be lost when the attribute is
        accessed again.

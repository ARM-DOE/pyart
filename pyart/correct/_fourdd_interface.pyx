    Create a RSL Volume containing sounding data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    radialVelVolume : _RslVolume
        Radial velocities which will be dealiased, shape used to create
        soundvolume.
    hc : ndarray
        Sounding heights in meters. Must be a contiguous one-dimensional
        float32 array.
    sc : ndarray
        Sounding wind speed in m/s. Must be a contiguous one-dimensional
        float32 array.
    dc : ndarray
        Sounding wind direction in degrees. Must be a contiguous
        one-dimensional float32 array.
    maxshear : float
        Maximum vertical shear which will be incorperated into the created
        volume.
    sign : int
        Sign convention which the radial velocities in the created volume
        will follow. A value of 1 represents when positive values
        velocities are towards the radar, -1 represents when negative
        velocities are towards the radar.

    Returns
    -------
    usuccess : int
        Flag indicating if loading of data was successful, 1 = yes, 0 = no.

    Dealias using the FourDD algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    radialVelVolume : _RslVolume
        Radial velocities which will be dealiased.
    lastVelVolume : _RslVolume or None
        Radial velocities from a previously dealiased radar volume. For best
        results, this radar should represent the previous volume scan in time.
        If the last velocity volume is unavailable, set this to None.
    soundVolume : _RslVolume or None
        Volume created from sounding data. If unavailable, set this to None.
        soundVolume and lastVelVolume cannot both be None.
    filt : int
        Flag controlling Bergen and Albers filter, 1 = yes, 0 = no.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    compthresh : float
        Fraction of the Nyquist velocity to use as a threshold when performing
        continity (initial) dealiasing. Velocities differences above this
        threshold will not be marked as gate from which to begin unfolding
        during spatial dealiasing.
    compthresh2 : float
        The same as compthresh but the value used during the second pass of
        dealasing. This second pass is only performed in both a sounding
        and last volume are provided.
    thresh : float
        Fraction of the Nyquist velocity to use as a threshold when performing
        spatial dealiasing. Horizontally adjacent gates with velocities above
        this theshold will count against assigning the gate in question the
        velocity value being tested.
    ckval : float
        When the absolute value of the velocities are below this value they
        will not be marked as gates from which to begin unfolding during
        spatial dealiasing.
    stdthresh : float
       Fraction of the Nyquist velocity to use as a standard deviation
       threshold in the window dealiasing portion of the algorithm.
    epsilon : float
        Difference used when comparing a value to missing value, changing this
        from the default is not recommended.
    maxcount : int
        Maximum allowed number of fold allowed when unfolding velocities.
    pass2 : int
        Controls weather unfolded gates should be removed (a value of 0)
        or retained for unfolding during the second pass (a value of 1) when
        both a sounding volume and last volume are provided.
    rm : int
        Determines what should be done with gates that are left unfolded
        after the first pass of dealiasing. A value of 1 will remove these
        gates, a value of 0 sets these gates to their initial velocity.  If
        both a sounding volume and last volume are provided this parameter is
        ignored.
    proximity : int
        Number of gates and rays to include of either side of the current gate
        during window dealiasing. This value may be doubled in cases where
        a standard sized window does not capture a sufficient number of
        good valued gates.
    mingood : int
        Number of good valued gates required within the window before the
        current gate will be unfolded.
    ba_mincount : int
        Number of neighbors required during Bergen and Albers filter for
        a given gate to be included, must be between 1 and 8, 5 recommended.
    ba_edgecount : int
        Same as ba_mincount but used at ray edges, must be between 1 and 5,
        3 recommended.
    debug : bool
        True to return RSL Volume objects for debugging:
        usuccess, radialVelVolume, lastVelVolume, soundVolume, unfoldedVolume

    Returns
    -------
    usuccess : int
        Flag indicating if the unfolding was successful, 1 = yes, 0 = no.
    data : np.ndarray
        Array of unfolded velocities.

    Map gates from one or more radars to a Cartesian grid.

    Generate a Cartesian grid of points for the requested fields from the
    collected points from one or more radars. For each radar gate that is not
    filtered a radius of influence is calculated.  The weighted field values
    for that gate are added to all grid points within that radius.  This
    routine scaled linearly with the number of radar gates and the effective
    grid size.

    Parameters not defined below are identical to those in
    :py:func:`map_to_grid`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roi_func : str or RoIFunction
        Radius of influence function.  A functions which takes an
        z, y, x grid location, in meters, and returns a radius (in meters)
        within which all collected points will be included in the weighting
        for that grid points. Examples can be found in the
        Typically following strings can use to specify a built in
        radius of influence function:

            * constant: constant radius of influence.
            * dist: radius grows with the distance from each radar.
            * dist_beam: radius grows with the distance from each radar
              and parameter are based of virtual beam sizes.

        A custom RoIFunction can be defined using the RoIFunction class
        and defining a get_roi method which returns the radius.  For efficient
        mapping this class should be implemented in Cython.

    Returns
    -------
    grids : dict
        Dictionary of mapped fields.  The keysof the dictionary are given by
        parameter fields.  Each elements is a `grid_size` float64 array
        containing the interpolated grid for that field.

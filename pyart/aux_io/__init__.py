"""
Additional classes and functions for reading and writing data from a number
of file formats.

These auxiliary input/output routines are not as well polished as those in
:mod:`pyart.io`. They may require addition dependencies beyond those required
for a standard Py-ART install, use non-standard function parameter and naming,
are not supported by the :py:func:`pyart.io.read` function and are not fully
tested if tested at all. Please use these at your own risk.

Bugs in these function should be reported but fixing them may not be a
priority.

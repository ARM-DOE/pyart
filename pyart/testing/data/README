This directory contains small example files for some of the radar formats
supported by Py-ART.  This files are used to test the functionality of Py-ART
and should not be used as real radar data sets.  

This directory should not be used directly, rather use the functionality of
the various pyart.testing functions and modules.

These files can be recreated from original radar files using the
make_small_* scripts.  These original radar files are not included in the 
Py-ART as they are quite large in size.

Plots of these example files can be made using the quick_plot_* scripts.
